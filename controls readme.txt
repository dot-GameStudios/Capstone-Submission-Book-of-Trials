Keyboard controls

wasd to move player

8 to add an attack from stream to queue
9 to refresh queue
0 to swap queue (this feature could be removed, but test when actual mana is added for balancing and replacing)

E to trigger top of attack queue

T to cycle lock on
(
if changing up the amount of enemies on the board from 3 to 2 or 1, go to combat manager and removed to linked enemy with the appropriate name and then click that enemies in the entity sidebar and disable it by turning off its isActive checkmark located at the top right of the info panle next to its name

do so sequentually. if you want to have 2 enemies on screen then turn off enemy 3. if you want to have 1 enemy turn off 2 and 3. dont have 1 enemy but its enemy3 for example or that will break the cycle logic
